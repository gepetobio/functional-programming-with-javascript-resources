# Functional Programming with JavaScript :: Resources

This is a list of resources I found while studying Functional Programming (FP) with JavaScript (JS). The more I study, the more I find resources that I like and then I'll put them down here... so this will keep growing!

But before we jump into that, it's important to say that you should have a deep understanding JavaScript basics. I thought I knew a lot about JavaScript but the more I study FP, the more I realise I have a partial knowledge of JS. So let's start with that:

## Learn JavaScript properly

If, like me, you started your career with jQuery, chances are that you do need some basic knowledge in JS. For that, I would suggest the following FREE series of books: You Don't Know JS (a.k.a. YDKJS)

* [Up & Going](up\%20&\%20going/README.md#you-dont-know-js-up--going)
* [Scope & Closures](scope\%20&\%20closures/README.md#you-dont-know-js-scope--closures)
* [this & Object Prototypes](this\%20&\%20object\%20prototypes/README.md#you-dont-know-js-this--object-prototypes)
* [Types & Grammar](types\%20&\%20grammar/README.md#you-dont-know-js-types--grammar)
* [Async & Performance](async\%20&\%20performance/README.md#you-dont-know-js-async--performance)
* [ES6 & Beyond](es6\%20&\%20beyond/README.md#you-dont-know-js-es6--beyond)

It doesn't mean you can only learn FP after you read them all (~~well, it kinda does~~), but it will definitely help you on your path to master it. I can't say I read them all until now, but that doesn't mean you should be as reckless as I am ;-)

## General resources

* [Fun Fun Function](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1cgjhGzsSYb1rsB4bFe4Q)

### Books
* [Javascript Allong√©](https://leanpub.com/javascriptallongesix/read) - possibly the earliest book about Functional Programming in Javascript. This is an revised edition including ES6 features.
* [Functional-Light JavaScript](https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS) - well, we are talking exactly about Functional Programming in JavaScript ;-)
* [Professor Frisby's Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide) - I came across this book several times. But after Kyle Sympson (the You Don't Know JS author) said he was a fan of this author, then I couldn't really leave it out of this list. I still need to read it though. But one thing at a time...


## Filter, Map and Reduce

It's quite important to master these 3 built-in JavaScript functions when you start learning FP. I wanted to practice them as much as possible, but it's not easy to find good exercises that are specific for each (~~unless they are challenges on some websites that you may use them or not~~~). So, looking for exercieses, I saw a post on reddit the other day:
